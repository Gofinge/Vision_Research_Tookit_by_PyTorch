# Vision Research Toolkit by PyTorch

Why should we build a new framework every time starting a new research? 

Welcome to VRT by PyTorch!

+ VRT is a high robust PyTorch-based framework for deep learning in computer vision, which aimed at easy-to-use, high efficiency, clean code and research.
+ The dataset in VRT is efficient enough to support all kind of task (seg, det, class, etc..)
+ All the parameters in VRT can be controlled in one config file.
+ VRT support single GPU and multi GPU, but do not support CPU.


## Acknowledgement
- The idea was inspired by the project [torchcv](http://github.com/gonnyyou/torchcv).
- The base framework is heavily influenced by [maskrcnn-benchmark](http://github.com/facebookreasearch/maskrcnn-benchmark), which is a really cool implementation of PyTorch.
